# Wichteln

It's a simple "Wichteln" app, made with angular and node.js.

## What is "Wichteln" ?

is a pre-Christmas, European custom that is cultivated among work colleagues, in clubs, in school classes, etc. By coincidental selection for each group member another group member is determined, by which it is then presented.

### Rules

The logic is implemented in a way that:
- nobody can draw himself
- nobody can draw his partner

## Development

Run `ng serve` for a dev server. Navigate to `http://localhost:4200/`. The app will automatically reload if you change any of the source files.

## Build

Run `ng build` to build the project. The build artifacts will be stored in the `dist/` directory. Use the `--prod` flag for a production build.

## Customize

Just enter all names of the participants with their partner in the data.json file and run "node draw".

## Running tests

Run `ng test` to execute the unit tests via [Karma](https://karma-runner.github.io) and run `ng e2e` to execute the end-to-end tests via [Protractor](http://www.protractortest.org/).

## Deployment
